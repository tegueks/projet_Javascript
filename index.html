    <h1>Let It Be</h1>
    <h3>Chanson de The Beatles â€§ 1970</h3>

        When I find myself in times of trouble, Mother Mary comes to me
        Speaking words of wisdom, let it be
        And in my hour of darkness she is standing right in front of me
        Speaking words of wisdom, let it be

        Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
        Whisper words of wisdom, let it be

        And when the broken hearted people living in the world agree
        There will be an answer, let it be
        For though they may be parted, there is still a chance that they will see
        There will be an answer, let it be

        Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
        There will be an answer, let it be

        Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
        Whisper words of wisdom, let it be

        Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
        Whisper words of wisdom, let it be, be

        And when the night is cloudy there is still a light that shines on me
        Shinin' until tomorrow, let it be
        I wake up to the sound of music, Mother Mary comes to me
        Speaking words of wisdom, let it be

        And let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
        Whisper words of wisdom, let it be

        And let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
        Whisper words of wisdom, let it be
